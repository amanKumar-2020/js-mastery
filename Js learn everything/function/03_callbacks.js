// Create a function called placeOrder(food, callback)
// that:
// Takes the food name and a callback function.
// Prints "Order received for <food>".
// After 2 seconds, calls the callback (which handles the next step).
// Then create another function prepareOrder(callback)
// that:
// Logs "Preparing your order...".
// After 3 seconds, calls another callback for delivery.
// Finally, a function deliverOrder() that logs "Your order is out for delivery!".
